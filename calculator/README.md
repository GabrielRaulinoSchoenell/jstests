## binary system
this code is a test for my skills in javascript. based on florinpop17/app-ideas, a git repository wich gives development ideas

## starting
we need to:

    allow user to see the last entered number //
    allow user to click or write 0-9, operations, C to clear and AC to clear all //
    allow user to enter 8 digits at max //  
    an operation button must allow to user: 
        <ul>
            <li>if there is only one number (n+=) -> sum n and n</li> //
            <li>if teo equals (n+n ==) n+n +n //
        </ul>
    user sees and base 10 exp if the result makes it throught 8 digits (99999999 + 1=) will display 1,0e9    
    

for bonus 

    user can click +/- to change the sign //
    user can click . to make floating numbers. the result will have 8 digits the last being a round (to upper or lower) //

    user has the experience of a calculator, not only put numbers (digits are displaied from right to left) //

## what did i learn?

    not to make a step bigger then the feet. i was really up to make this project... so instead of beggining from the start line,
    i tried to make the code a clean fast code (i've already made many calculators, and some of them problably faster than this).
    the code is now really easy to implement new funcionalities (hope so)

    parseFloat parses a string to a number even if it's not an actual decimal.

    improved my logic skills and programming ones at all. i messed up with time sometimes, cause at start i was programming really fast, with time however i needed to stop and play calm. i gone out of my computer sometimes (to wash the dishes and make another stuff) and forgetten to stop the stop watch, so the time is not that precise

## info
i spent 2 hours 42 minutes 55 seconds making this code, only taking README.md wich i've made just before starting the code

counting with my "needs" and "wash" i think this time would drop to 2 hours or less. 

that was pretty easy, i think i could only improve my time 

this is a really simple code, and with OOP this code is readable and really intuitive. my objective's been concluded
