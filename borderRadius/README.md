## info

i spent 1 hour 43 minutes and 06 seconds making this code. (don't worry, much of it's been in crying cause didn't work [kidding i don't do that {or maybe}])

i made a different thing of what's been said me to do, using a swipe function i've never tried before, my first excuse for the time

that was pretty easy, I unfortunately spent too much time trying to low my lines count using object orientation. 
as you can see in the code, the initial idea was not to use the switch case, however after a lot of time passed i just gave up of trying this way
(due to a error, while i was trying to make box.style.module, wich should return me a borderRadius parameter, but instead returned only errors) 

it's 1:02 am, hope you excuse my delay.

my objective's been concluded
