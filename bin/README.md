## starting

we need to: 

    allow user to insert 8 binary digits
    only allow user to insert 0 or 1, and notificate if it's not been put
    user will see the decimal correspondent of the binary number

## what did I learn?

convertion to decimal

code efficience using foreach (I actually knew how to use, but there were some doubt, everything've been right tough)


## info

i spent 29 minutes and 56 seconds making this code. (plus some 3 or 5 i spent making html and css but i wasn't counting)

that was pretty easy, i needed to search how to covert binary to decimal tough 

there are bugs, wich i fixed only after stoping the watch. my objective've been concluded
