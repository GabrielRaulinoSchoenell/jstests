# csv2json converter
this code is a test for my skills in javascript. based in csv2json, a git repository wich gives development ideas

## starting

we need to: 

    allow user to paste csv in a textarea
    allow user to click convert to json to convert text to json
    user can only insert csv in the text area
    user can copy the converted text to clipboard (ha easy peasy)

## what did i learn?

    how to create a object inderectaly, by making a loop to decide it's keys and it's values

    what's csv, cause i've never worked with it

    how to use Regex in javascript

    practice with JSON, wich i knew but hadn't have time enough to be expertize

## info

i spent 34  minutes to learn how codify a regex (and made some tests that gone wrong). now i'm tired so i'm gonna sleep
i spent 31 minutes to finish the code. problably there are many problems, such as space usage, my mission is concluded tough

i really don't agree by putting this challange in begginer cathegory. cause problably:
    1. begginners won't be so sure of how to use loops (in this case loop inside loop)
    2. begginners won't know what's a csv (i didn't)
    3. begginners won't know Regex
    4. begginners won't know JSON

it's a junior javascript test. junior !== begginer.
