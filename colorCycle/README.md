## starting

we need to: 

    Allow user to specify a starting fill color as a six hexadecimal standard CSS color code in three individual components of two digits each - red,   blue, and green
    allow user to specify an increment value for each color component that will be added to that component every .25 second
    allow user to see the box containing the fill color change every .25 seconds

## what did i learn?

    efficiency is not always the way... i mean, at least when you have no idea of what you're doing

## info
i spent 1 hour 10 minutes to make this code. the hardest thing was to find a way to make the colors switch one by one
problaly there're better ways to do this, but it's working, so

all my job here is done!
