## starting

we need to: 

    allow user to create event
    allow user to edit event
    allow user to exclude event

    i tought that it'd be really better if the calendar was a traditional calendar. 
    there're more items such as drag and drop and DB process... i decided to don't do that, focusing more in date()

## what did i learn?

    code efficience

    learned more about dates 

## info

i spent 1 hour 40 minutes doing the code (including html and css)

incredible simple, a lot of work tough

my work is done here!
